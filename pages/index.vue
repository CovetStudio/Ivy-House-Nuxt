<p class="is-4">
Connecting the right person to the right company is a privilege that Ivy House Recruiting is passionate about. We are a company that truly gets to know our candidates before we know if they are an appropriate fit for you.  Ivy House is not in the business of sending our clients a ton of resumes for them to filter through, just to make our own metrics look good. We seek top of the line candidates that meet or exceed your expectations. Striving to find a mutual fit, so both parties can thrive and succeed together. Ivy House promises to only send you the very best. Through our pre-screening process we are able to determine if someone is going to fit the mold that your team specifically needs. Once approved, we remain there for both our clients, and our candidates. We make sure that interviews are professional, seamless, and well-coordinated. Every-step of the way Ivy House Recruiting is there for you.

<h2 class="subtitle">OUR FOUNDER<br/>Brittney Lapham</h2>
 <p>
Brittney Lapham started Ivy House Recruiting after working in professional recruiting and business development for over half a decade. First achieving her B.A. ata  Southeastern University in Lakeland Florida, she studied Public Relations and Journalism. Brittney then went abroad to Winchester, United Kingdom, to obtain her Masters in Managing Contemporary Global Issues. She is also the daughter of a United States Army Colonel/Assemblies of God Pastor and a Multi-tasking Superhero, who have taught her to live with honor and integrity. This upbringing also allowed her to live all over the world, furthering her foundation in servant leadership. Brittney has now settled in Nashville, Tennessee, where she has lived for 7 years. She is dedicated to her job, and her job is her passion. When she is not working on finding you the next perfect member for your team, you can find her (and her rescue dog Millie) on the hiking trails of beautiful Tennessee.
